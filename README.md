## Tab Saver

Simple Firefox extension to quickly save a window and it's tabs to reopen at any time.


## How to Install (Temporary Load)

- Open Firefox â†’ Go to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
- Click "Load Temporary Add-on".
- Select `manifest.json` file


## TODO

- Add Update/overwrite/re-save (see branch)
  - dont open dialog if click save on empty box

- Bring to top when open (or when click resave)
- Add latest to top rather than bottom
- if tabs are selected just save those
- Orig idea that delete button turns to undo - but that has not worked.
